## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

### Cooperative

Make a list of each parson’s strengths.

Chris - Technical aptitude, problem solving, solid understanding of concepts

Peter - Technical aptitude, problem solving, solid understanding of concepts

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

We will use our combined knowledge and understanding of the technologies we're using to develop our application.

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

Chris - wants to improve knowledge of JavaScript syntax

Peter - collaboration and pair programming

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

If one of us doesn't fully understand something, we will take the time to solidify our understanding

### Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

Talk about it

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

Bring it to the attention of the other member and try to reach a resolution

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place
in understanding and skill level?

We will take the time to ensure both of us have a solid understanding of concepts
